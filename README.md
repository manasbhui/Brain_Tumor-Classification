# Brain_tumor Classification
Traditional manual prognosis and brain tumor type verification are sensitive processes with a higher likelihood of inaccuracy, influenced by various factors. For instance, the standard Local Binary Pattern (LBP) image representation lacks the ability to capture nuanced high-level information, making it less effective in distinguishing subtle texture variations within brain tumor images. Moreover, LBP may be susceptible to image noise and employs a fixed neighborhood size, which might not adequately capture textures at different scales or orientations.

To overcome these limitations and enhance the accuracy of our classification, we have employed an innovative approach. We utilized LBP to extract texture features from brain tumor MRI images, followed by the creation of a texture difference map by subtracting the original image from the LBP-extracted version. This map effectively accentuates the distinctive textures associated with tumor regions, mitigating some of the shortcomings of the standard LBP approach and ultimately improving the accuracy of our brain tumor classification system.

Our experimental results underscore the efficacy of this approach, achieving an impressive classification accuracy of 95.44%. This high accuracy underscores the potential of the LBP-based texture feature extraction in conjunction with the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) classification method for brain tumor classification tasks, effectively addressing some of the limitations inherent in the standard LBP representation.

Furthermore, we have explored data augmentation techniques, such as contrast jittering, horizontal flipping, rotation, and shearing, applied to the original images. Subsequently, LBP features were extracted from these augmented images, providing an untapped resource for training and testing. This augmentation process presents a promising avenue for improving the model's generalization capability and overall classification performance, serving as a potential area for future research and enhancement.
