# Brain Tumor Classification
The challenges posed by brain tumors in today's world are multifaceted and complex. While developments in medical science and research have somewhat enhanced our understanding of brain tumors, the intricate anatomy of the brain still makes it difficult for doctors to accurately diagnose this condition. Proper diagnosis of brain tumor type and risk assessment is highly important to facilitate the treatment process and increase the patient's chances of recovery. Manual prognosis and verification of brain tumor type are sensitive and have high chances of inaccuracy due to several factors. The standard Local Binary Pattern (LBP) image representation, for instance, lacks the capacity to capture higher-level information, making it less effective at distinguishing subtle texture differences within brain tumor images. Additionally, LBP can be sensitive to noise in the images, and it uses a fixed neighborhood size, which may not adequately capture textures at varying scales or orientations. To address these limitations and enhance the accuracy of our classification, we employed an innovative approach. We applied LBP to extract texture features from brain tumor MRI images and then created a texture difference map by subtracting the original image from the LBP extracted image. This map effectively highlights the distinctive textures associated with tumor regions, mitigating some of the drawbacks of standard LBP and ultimately improving the accuracy of our brain tumor classification system. Our experimental results demonstrated the efficacy of this approach, achieving an impressive classification accuracy of 95.44%. This high accuracy showcases the potential of the LBP-based texture feature extraction and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) classification method for brain tumor classification tasks, addressing some of the limitations posed by standard LBP representation. Furthermore, data augmentation techniques such as contrast jittering, horizontal flipping, rotation, and shearing were applied to the original image. Subsequently, LBP features were extracted from the augmented images which are not yet utilized for training and testing. The augmentation process is more likely a future scope that can potentially improve the model's generalization capability and overall classification.
